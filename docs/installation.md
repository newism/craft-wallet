# Installation

You can install Wallet Passes via the plugin store, or through Composer.

**Requirements:**

* Craft CMS 5.6+
* PHP 8.2+

## Craft Plugin Store

To install **Wallet Passes**, navigate to the Plugin Store section of your Craft control panel, search for `Wallet Passes newism`, and click the Try button.

## Composer

You can also add the package to your project using Composer and the command line.

Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
```

Then require and install the plugin:

```bash
composer require newism/craft-wallet
php craft plugin/install wallet
```

When the plugin is installed, it automatically copies starter config files (READMEs, placeholder images) to your project's `config/wallet/` directory. See [Setup](./setup) for Apple Wallet and Google Wallet configuration.

## Licensing

You can try Wallet Passes in a development environment for as long as you like. Once your site goes live, you are required to purchase a license for the plugin.

For more information, see [Craft's Commercial Plugin Licensing](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/system/plugins.html#commercial-plugin-licensing).
